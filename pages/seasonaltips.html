                        <li><strong>Garden Prep:</strong> Clear away winter debris, dead leaves, and weeds. Amend your garden beds with compost to enrich the soil. This is also the perfect time to start seeds indoors for warm-weather plants like tomatoes and peppers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Home Maintenance:</strong> Clean your gutters, wash windows inside and out, and check for any damage to your home's exterior that may have occurred over winter.</li>
                        <li><strong>DIY Project:</strong> Build and install a rain barrel. Collecting spring rain is an eco-friendly way to water your garden throughout the drier summer months.</li>

                        <li><strong>Home Refresh:</strong> Lighten up your decor. Swap heavy throws for lightweight linen or cotton. Bring in fresh flowers from your garden to brighten up indoor spaces.</li>
                        <li><strong>DIY Project:</strong> Build a simple outdoor bench or a set of Adirondack chairs. Create a comfortable spot to sit back and enjoy your beautiful garden on long summer evenings.</li>

                        <li><strong>Garden Wind-Down:</strong> Harvest root vegetables and winter squash. Plant garlic and spring-blooming bulbs. Rake leaves and add them to your compost pile to create nutrient-rich "black gold" for next year.</li>
                        <li><strong>Home Coziness:</strong> Bring out warmer textiles like wool blankets and velvet pillows. Check your heating system and seal any drafts around windows and doors.</li>

                        <li><strong>Garden Planning:</strong> Browse seed catalogs and sketch out your garden plan for next spring. Clean and sharpen your garden tools so they're ready to go when the ground thaws.</li>
                        <li><strong>Indoor Greenery:</strong> Care for your houseplants. With less natural light, be careful not to overwater. This is a great time to tackle an indoor plant-related DIY, like building a tiered plant stand.</li>
                        <li><strong>DIY Project:</strong> Organize your workshop or craft space. Build simple storage solutions like shelves or a pegboard system to get ready for a productive year of making.</li>
