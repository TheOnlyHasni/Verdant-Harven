                    <h2>The Heart of a Sustainable Home</h2>
                    <p>Sustainable living is about making conscious choices to reduce our environmental footprint. It's not about perfection, but about progress. At Verdant Haven, we believe this journey begins at home. By integrating eco-friendly habits into our daily lives, we can create healthier spaces for ourselves and contribute to a healthier planet.</p>

                    <h3>Where to Begin?</h3>
                    <p>Starting can feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. Focus on the three R's: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Think about how you can reduce consumption, reuse items instead of discarding them, and recycle properly. In the garden, this translates to composting kitchen scraps, harvesting rainwater, and choosing native plants that require less water and support local wildlife.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Actionable Tips for a Greener Home:</h3>
                    <ul class="article-list">
                        <li><strong>Start a Compost Bin:</strong> Turn your kitchen scraps into nutrient-rich soil for your garden.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conserve Water:</strong> Install a rain barrel to collect water for your plants and choose drought-tolerant species.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reduce Plastic Use:</strong> Opt for reusable shopping bags, water bottles, and food containers. Choose garden tools made from wood and metal over plastic.</li>
                        <li><strong>DIY Natural Cleaners:</strong> Create your own non-toxic cleaning solutions using simple ingredients like vinegar, baking soda, and lemon.</li>
                        <li><strong>Support Pollinators:</strong> Plant flowers that attract bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects to your garden.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Every small step contributes to a larger movement. Join us in making choices that honor our connection to the natural world.</p>
