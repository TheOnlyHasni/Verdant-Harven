                    <h2>The Organized Maker: Maximizing Your Space</h2>
                    <p>A great workshop isn't about size; it's about organization and workflow. Whether you have a dedicated garage or a small corner in your apartment, these principles will help you create a more efficient and enjoyable workspace.</p>

                    <h3>1. Go Vertical with Storage</h3>
                    <p>Wall space is your best friend. Use pegboards, French cleats, or simple shelves to get tools and materials off your workbench and into plain sight. This not only frees up valuable surface area but also makes it easier to find what you need.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Create Dedicated Zones</h3>
                    <p>Even in a small space, try to create zones for different tasks. Have a designated area for cutting and assembly, a separate spot for finishing (painting/staining), and a clean zone for planning and measuring. This prevents cross-contamination (like sawdust on a freshly painted project) and keeps you organized.</p>

                    <h3>3. Invest in Good Lighting</h3>
                    <p>You can't build what you can't see. Good lighting is crucial for both safety and accuracy. Supplement overhead lighting with task lighting, such as an adjustable lamp over your workbench or LED strip lights under shelves.</p>

                    <h3>4. Mobility is Key</h3>
                    <p>If your space is multi-purpose, put your larger tools and workbenches on locking casters. This allows you to reconfigure your shop for different projects. A large assembly table can be rolled out of the way when you need open floor space.</p>

                    <h3>5. "A Place for Everything..."</h3>
                    <p>The old saying holds true. Use clear bins, labeled drawers, and magnetic strips to organize small items like screws, nails, and drill bits. At the end of each work session, take 5-10 minutes to put everything back in its designated spot. This habit will save you hours of searching in the long run.</p>
