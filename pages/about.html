                <h2 class="our-story__title">How Verdant Haven Began</h2>
                <p class="our-story__text">It all started with a simple observation: in a world that's always moving faster, we felt a growing disconnect from the natural world. Our own journey began with trying to turn a small city apartment into a green, calming space. That personal project sparked a passion that we knew we had to share.</p>
                <p class="our-story__text">We started small, running weekend workshops to show fellow city dwellers how to bring plants into their homes. The response was incredible. It turned out we weren't the only ones craving a home that felt more alive and connected to nature. That's when Verdant Haven truly came to life.</p>
                <p class="our-story__text">Today, we're a resource for a wonderful community of readers, but our core belief is the same as it was on day one: everyone deserves a personal sanctuary, no matter the size of their space or budget.</p>
