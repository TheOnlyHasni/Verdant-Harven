                    <h2>Your First DIY Toolkit: The 5 Must-Haves</h2>
                    <p>You don't need a professional workshop to start creating. A small, well-chosen set of tools can handle the vast majority of beginner DIY projects. Here are the five essentials we recommend for every new toolkit.</p>

                    <ul class="article-list">
                        <li><strong>Cordless Drill/Driver:</strong> The workhorse of any toolkit. Perfect for drilling holes and driving screws. Look for a model with a variable speed trigger and an adjustable clutch.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tape Measure:</strong> Accuracy is key in DIY. A sturdy 25-foot tape measure is a non-negotiable for getting your projects right.</li>
                        <li><strong>Claw Hammer:</strong> For more than just hanging pictures. A 16-ounce hammer is versatile enough for assembling projects and for light demolition.</li>
                        <li><strong>Utility Knife:</strong> From opening boxes to scoring drywall, a sharp utility knife with a retractable blade is an indispensable tool.</li>
                        <li><strong>Level:</strong> Whether you're hanging a shelf or building a frame, a 24-inch level ensures your work is perfectly horizontal or vertical.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="article-spacing-top">DIY Safety Fundamentals</h2>
                    <p>Working with tools is rewarding, but safety must always come first. These are the non-negotiable rules to follow before you start any project.</p>

                    <ul class="article-list">
                        <li><strong>Always Wear Safety Glasses:</strong> Protect your eyes from dust, debris, and flying objects. This is the most important rule of DIY.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protect Your Hearing:</strong> Power tools like saws and sanders can be loud. Use earplugs or earmuffs to prevent hearing damage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Read the Manual:</strong> Every tool is different. Understand how your specific tool works, including its safety features, before you plug it in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep a Tidy Workspace:</strong> A cluttered area is a dangerous area. Keep your workspace clean to prevent trips, falls, and other accidents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Disconnect Power:</strong> Always unplug tools before changing blades or bits. Never leave a power tool running unattended.</li>
