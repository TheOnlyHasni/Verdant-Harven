                        <p>Yellow leaves are one of the most common plant issues and can have several causes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Overwatering:</strong> This is the most frequent cause. Soil that is constantly wet suffocates the roots. Check if the soil is soggy. Let the top 1-2 inches of soil dry out before watering again.</li>
                            <li><strong>Underwatering:</strong> If the leaves are yellow and crispy, the plant may be too dry. Water thoroughly until it drains from the bottom.</li>
                            <li><strong>Nutrient Deficiency:</strong> Yellowing, especially on older leaves, can indicate a lack of nitrogen. Consider using a balanced, all-purpose fertilizer during the growing season.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lighting Issues:</strong> Too little light can cause lower leaves to yellow and drop. Too much direct sun can scorch leaves, causing them to yellow.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </details>

                <details class="problem-solver__item">
                    <summary class="problem-solver__question">What are these tiny white webs on my plant?</summary>
                    <div class="problem-solver__answer">
                        <p>Fine, silky webs, especially on the undersides of leaves and where leaves join the stem, are a classic sign of <strong>spider mites</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Isolate the plant to prevent spreading. You can often control a small infestation by wiping the leaves with a damp cloth or spraying the plant with water in the shower. For more persistent issues, use an insecticidal soap or neem oil spray, making sure to cover all surfaces of the plant.</p>

                <details class="problem-solver__item">
                    <summary class="problem-solver__question">My plant has brown, crispy leaf tips. What's wrong?</summary>
                    <div class="problem-solver__answer">
                        <p>Brown, crispy tips are most often a sign of low humidity or inconsistent watering.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Low Humidity:</strong> Many common houseplants are tropical and prefer higher humidity than our homes provide. Try misting your plants, placing them on a pebble tray with water, or using a small humidifier.</li>
                            <li><strong>Water Quality:</strong> Tap water can contain minerals (like fluoride and chlorine) that build up in the soil and cause leaf tips to burn. Try using filtered or distilled water, or let tap water sit out overnight before using.</li>
                            <li><strong>Underwatering:</strong> Allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings can also cause crispy tips. Aim for consistently moist (but not soggy) soil.</li>
                        </ul>

                <details class="problem-solver__item">
                    <summary class="problem-solver__question">There's a white, powdery substance on the leaves.</summary>
                    <div class="problem-solver__answer">
                        <p>This sounds like <strong>powdery mildew</strong>, a common fungal disease that thrives in high humidity with poor air circulation.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Improve air circulation around your plants. You can treat affected leaves by spraying with a solution of one tablespoon of baking soda and half a teaspoon of liquid soap mixed in a gallon of water. Neem oil is also an effective treatment. Remove heavily infected leaves.</p>
